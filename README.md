# Proj 1

This project allows a user to start a word search game. 

The game starts with an input file, containing the 15 x 15 Word

Search (grid of letters) and a list of 10 words for find.

Words appear in any direction from left to right, or right to left,

from top to bottom, from bottom to top, and diagonally.

The user is tasked get all the proper XY coordinates where a

guess word starts and ends to succeed and complete the Word Search.
